# Ansible

A home for all of my Ansible plays.

## Prerequisites
### Ansible
The first thing you will need is an ansible installed on your management station (desktop/laptop, probably where you are reading this from). See my [host setup](https://docs.calebsargeant.com/en/latest/other/general/host-setup.html) documentation.
